# Capstone Project #1
This is my Capstone project 1. It's a simplified version of "my resume" which just demonstrates simple HTML

Open up your terminal, I would recommend VSCode. Then copy and paste the following command lines
git clone https://github.com/Darky321/Capstone-Project-1.git
cd Capstone\ Project\ 1/
Your code is now set up. Now steps to run it on your computer.

In your editor, I use VScode, go into Capstone Project 1 and right click index.html
Click "Show Preview"
In the top right of the Preview click the 3 lines and click Open in Browser Now you have full access to the website in your browser.
